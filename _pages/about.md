I am a Ph.D. candidate in Chemical Engineering and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan working with Professor [Rebecca K. Lindsey]() and Professor [Sharon C. Glotzer](). My research project closely involves generating physics-informed design surface for polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) using machine-learning based approaches. I have utilized tools including [LAMMPS], [HOOMD-Blue], [ChIMES], and [Signac].
