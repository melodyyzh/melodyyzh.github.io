I am a Ph.D. candidate in Chemical Engineering and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan working with Professor [Rebecca K. Lindsey](https://lindseylab.engin.umich.edu/) and Professor [Sharon C. Glotzer](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/). My research project closely involves generating physics-informed design surface for polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) using machine-learning based approaches. I have utilized tools including [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/), [HOOMD-Blue](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/v4.6.0/), [ChIMES_lsq](https://chimes-lsq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [ChIMES_calculator](https://chimes-calculator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [Signac](https://docs.signac.io/en/latest/).
