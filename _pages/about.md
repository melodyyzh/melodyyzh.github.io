I am a Ph.D. candidate in Chemical Engineering and Scientific Computing at the University of Michigan, working with Professors [Rebecca K. Lindsey](https://lindseylab.engin.umich.edu/) and Professor [Sharon C. Glotzer](https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/home/). My research focuses on developing a physics-informed machine-learned interaction model (ML-IAM) that incorporates detailed chemical and physical design parameters for coarse-grained (CG) nanomaterials. This work lays the foundation for further advancements in physics-informed CG ML-IAMs, ultimately facilitating the design and discovery of novel nanomaterials.

I have extensive experience with molecular simulation engines, including [LAMMPS](https://docs.lammps.org/) and [HOOMD-Blue](https://hoomd-blue.readthedocs.io/en/v4.6.0/), as well as ML-IAM frameworks like [ChIMES_lsq](https://chimes-lsq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [ChIMES_calculator](https://chimes-calculator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), scikit-learn, and PyTorch. Additionally, I work with workflow management tools such as [Signac](https://docs.signac.io/en/latest/) and have experience utilizing HPC clusters, including TACC STAMPEDE3 and NCSA Delta. Beyond my core research, I have a strong interest in data science and are familiar with tools like SQL and Pandas.

Outside of academia, I enjoy cardio-based boxing and kickboxing, photography, console gaming, baking, running, and playing the piano. Iâ€™m always excited to learn new things and introduce friends to my hobbies.
